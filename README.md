# Irish Lyrics Generation using LSTM

This project generates Irish lyrics using a language model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It trains on a dataset of Irish song lyrics and generates new lyrics based on the patterns and structure learned from the training data.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip or download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download


## Dataset

Download  the irish-lyrics dataset and put them in the same directory, which contains the Irish song lyrics data. Each line in the file represents a separate song or verse.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/irish-lyrics-generation.git

2. Change into the project directory: cd irish-lyrics-generation

3. Run all the cells in the notebook if you are using 

## Customization

- To adjust the number of generated words, modify the `next_words` variable in the code.
- You can experiment with different LSTM model architectures and hyperparameters to improve the quality of the generated lyrics.
